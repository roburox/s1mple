# simplicity hub without logging + kept together in one place
all of simplicity in one place, in case he deletes/chooses to private his stuff

# why?
bc his source was all over the place, not kept together in the same repository
if you wanted to make a copy of his stuff, you would've needed to clone ALL of his repositories (each single script that is in the folder script here)
I also added the actual sources to some of the hubs linked in his hub

and he has a logger on his loadstring (I don't even know if it still works bc idk if the server is still up)
proof: https://github.com/HeyGyt/cubemonster/commit/cce2d93c7922230b3b703bda75a13ed56a8b219e
- idk why he decided to obfuscate it later on
(plus his discord announcement)
